# Car-Data-Analysis
This project which I completed using Panda, NumPy, and MatPlotLib is designed to clean and interpret data based on a dataset containing 10,000 rows of recent cars.
In this project I answered questions such as "What is the average price of cars by brand and model?". I tackled various descriptive, exploratory, and comaparative analysis questions within
this project in the aims of providing a better understanding of the dataset.
